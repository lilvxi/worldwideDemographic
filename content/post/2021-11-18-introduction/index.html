<p>At the beginning, an overall scatter plot is adopted to generate the whole situation. 
Thus, income level appears to be a vital factor to dig deeper. In this way, five representatives within each income level 
have been chosen to generate the population situation. Despite the income level, 
life expectancy values a lot in this case.
Afterward, someone may consider whether there exist other external factors for this case. 
Therefore, a worldwide fertility rate for different geographic locations has been plotted out.
